<h3> Description: </h3>
<h4>This is a test assignment done for 24EastYard. It's main goal is to use <b>React.JS</b> to build a search filter including input components of several types including:
<ul>
<li>A price range filter (this one was so tricky)</li>
<li>A date range picker <b>with icons</b></li>
<li>A numeric input <b>with icon</b> and an alphabetical one </li>
<li>Dropdown inputs</li>
<li>A menu prompted by a button</li>
</ul>
The <b>Result</b> of the search would include a <i>card</i> and a <i>map</i> to display the filtered result.
</h4>
<h5> Unfortunately, I ran out of time before being able to finish it all :disappointed: <h5>
<h4> What's missing? <br>
<b>The functionality of buttons which allow the filter to work. Search, switch, Apply and Clear all are not functional at the moment and the website is not responsive but would definitely love to work on them and finish the features.</b>
</h4>
<h3> <b> Library used :</b>
<ul>
<li>Material UI</li>
</ul>
</h4> <b> WHY?  </b> <br>
Because when I saw the design I thought that almost all of the components look a lot like the Material UI ones. As well as I knew how flexible the components can be and how much it saves time to use it <br>
I had 2 days just looking for a price range that looks as awesome as the one from the UI design, I have allll of Google first 3 pages of links marked purple :sweat_smile: </h4>

<h3> Things I learned </h3>
<h4>
<ul>
<li>That a week isn't a long time</li>
<li>That if it looks easy, it isn't</li>
<li>That I really do not know how my brain figures out stuff sometimes</li>
<li>That reading an doc carefully would definitely make a difference</li>
<li>That I hate flex until it works</li>
<li>Again and again, that coding is so much fun and incredibly rewarding</li>
</ul>
</h4>

<h3> How does it run? </h3>
 In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console. -->
