## Purpose of the project:

- Practice **REACT** because it rocks!
- Try to add features I haven't worked on before
- Design and execute a clean and simple webpage
- Use a library (Materail UI)

## Usage:
Basically, it is simply a search engine, designed to filter results through different type of inputs and show results upon pressing **search**
*Note: the data in the input and search result is static*

## Design:
I aimed for a nice design, colorful, lively and for it to be user friendly
