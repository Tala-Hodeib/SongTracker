# Welcome to Song Tracker!

## Purpose of the project:

- Practice **REACT** because it rocks!
- Try to add features I haven't worked on before
- Design and execute a clean and simple webpage
- Use a library (Materail UI)

## Usage:
Basically, it is simply a search engine, designed to filter results through different type of inputs and show results upon pressing **search**
*Note: the data in the input and search result is static*

## Design:
I aimed for a nice design, colorful, lively and for it to be user friendly


### How does it run? 
 In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

*Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.*
