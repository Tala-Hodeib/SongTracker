### **Description:**
</div>
#### This is a test assignment done for 24EastYard. It's main goal is to use *React.JS* to build a search filter including input components of several types including:
-A price range filter (this one was so tricky)
-A date range picker *with icons*
-A numeric input *with icon* and an alphabetical one 
-Dropdown inputs
-A menu prompted by a button
The **Result** of the search would include a **card** and a **map** to display the filtered result.
##### Unfortunately, I ran out of time before being able to finish it all :disappointed: .
#### What's missing?
The functionality of buttons which allow the filter to work. Search, switch, Apply and Clear all are not functional at the moment but would definitely love to work on them and finish the features.
